### Why?
Because Ryuk used eval in bash version for 3 years and it just didnt sit right with him.
BUT the day before he was ready to push the C version he found a way to make bash version work without eval.
So now this exists as a project that he used to learn C [Was challenged by [THIS PERSON](https://github.com/likeadragonmaid)]
